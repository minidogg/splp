# SPLP
Simple Playlist Player (SPLP) is meant to be a simple tool for loading audio files and listening to them.

## Note
This is meant to be my pet project. If you are looking to work on an extensive audio player, please just make your own or a fork of this one.

## Features

### Loading from URL
When you load from URL you can provide a URL to a ".txt" file that includes a list of URLs to load from.
